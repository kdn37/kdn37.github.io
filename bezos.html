<p>Bezos has described the most challenging part of his work finding himself in the right mental state to make sharp accurate decisions, he believes that if you aren’t mentally sharp, your decision making can be influenced to things that you don’t want or aren’t going to be successful which is why he employs the idea that he needs a minimum of eight hours sleep and will try to do his most mentally challenging tasks in the morning around 10am when he is most sharp. The other window where he believes is the peak of his productivity is early evening and he will also do a lot of his work during this productive period.</p>
