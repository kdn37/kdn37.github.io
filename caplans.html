When I first started this subject, I came in with the idea of being a games developer but through my learning in the subject I have gained a respect for the depth of career possibilities in the world of IT. Learning through our weekly subject I have been particularly interested in machine learning and some outside research brings me to an interest in data analyst style role. However, it is still up in the air with what I want to do at the end of this course Iâ€™m just looking forward to building upon my skills and toolset in the IT space and trying to get good at many subjects and decide what I want to do from there.

Prior to beginning this course I had a generic understand what IT was and how it forms part of our everyday life. The portions of certain industry grab my attention such as gaming, blockchain and lead me to the rabbit hole of learning more on software engineering and the demand and pre-requisites for those particular roles. While progressing on the third assignment, I spent some time familiarising with Adobe XD with app development and in the roles of UI and UX design it has broadened my view of roles that extend within the design field. I do digital design and art in my downtime, as a hobby and for clients and it is a field that doesn't feign interest and further on I envisage to explore more of these positions as possible.

While also (and attempting to juggle my commitments as best as possible) diving into Intro to Programming, it gave me greater scope of the skills and requirements to be associated with doing UI and UX design, and before doing this unit it's helped make a few things clearer in terms of a direction I would aim to work towards.
