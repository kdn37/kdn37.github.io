When I first started this subject, I came in with the idea of being a games developer but through my learning in the subject I have gained a respect for the depth of career possibilities in the world of IT. Learning through our weekly subject I have been particularly interested in machine learning and some outside research brings me to an interest in data analyst style role. However, it is still up in the air with what I want to do at the end of this course I’m just looking forward to building upon my skills and toolset in the IT space and trying to get good at many subjects and decide what I want to do from there.

Prior to beginning this course I had a generic understand what IT was and how it forms part of our everyday life. The portions of certain industry grab my attention such as gaming, blockchain and lead me to the rabbit hole of learning more on software engineering and the demand and pre-requisites for those particular roles. While progressing on the third assignment, I spent some time familiarising with Adobe XD with app development and in the roles of UI and UX design it has broadened my view of roles that extend within the design field. I do digital design and art in my downtime, as a hobby and for clients and it is a field that doesn't feign interest and further on I envisage to explore more of these positions as possible.<br><br>

While also (and attempting to juggle my commitments as best as possible) diving into Intro to Programming, it gave me greater scope of the skills and requirements to be associated with doing UI and UX design, and before doing this unit it's helped make a few things clearer in terms of a direction I would aim to work towards.<br><br>
	
Furthermore, it's made me assess where I could potentially look for as a career, gauging from the learnings done in the previous assignment, how the demand for software developers and engineers are forecasted to be in great demand and the path on developing a career in that has at this time made me re-evaluate my current trajectory.<br><br>
	
	In the interest field of becoming a <strong>User Interface Developer</strong>, there are career pathways outlined on Seek.com.au where there is offerings of a Bachelor of Computer Science available at Deakin University as well as RMIT University, both in an online/on-campus capacity. Given my commitment to graduating at Griffith University on completion of my Bachelor of Business degree, the focus for myself will be to further explore these offerings of Computer Science and undertake personal projects in application development and further work on a portfolio. I also aim to further enhance my skillset with becoming more comfortable with Adobe XD, either through boot camps, short courses or by self teaching methods as I had done with other programs. <br><br>

From where and when I compare my initial standing when I began this unit of study I can say that I am surprised that I find myself more aligned to learning more about app development and have to say this has been the highlight of my experience with this third assignment.
	<br><br>Here is a proposed career plan I've developed in order to guide myself in learnings and requirements needed with the hypothetical career I've re-aligned myself to. Anticipated timeframe is five years, due to my commitment to the Business degree I've currently enrolled in.
