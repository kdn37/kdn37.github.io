<div style=margin:60px>
	<h2>Entering this unit of study collectively it looks like we have similar passions with motivations stemming from video games, it would be somewhat preconceived to assume that the skillset would have our individual roles be affirmed of high value in any sector of the IT industry. Because of the foundations found with core programming skills they are relatively transferable across multiple fields, as a video game is essentially - software.</h2></div>

	<h2>Assessing the content it can be validated that although the same career goals may align individually, it would be foolish to think that these goals would not change, as technology evolves so do the demands of them. Where competencies in C++/C# programming being of importance in these fields, they are relatively transferable to other sectors of the industry. Just like any industry, experience is something to be gained, whether on an employed or voluntary basis, the route is clear in the form to exhibit to prospective employer. It can also be classed as to how some game studios form independently, as historically there are firms established amongst friends and students in the past, such as Rare and Game Freak. </h2></div>
