<center><h1>Industry Data</h1></center>
<div style=margin:60px>
After analysing our individual ideal positions for employment, it can be assessed that uniquely we share similar goals which is driven from our shared passion of video games, because of this we report on industry data that is relevant to game development. According to data by IGEA, programmers and engineers are the highest in demand roles in Australia’s gaming industry – representing 34% of the workforce, with artists representing 23%, managers, admin and marketing 14% and the remaining workforce is divided amongst designers, producers, quality assurance, sound design, writers and other skills (IGEA, 2021). Given the nature of the positions that the team of Thirty Seven have aspirations for, outlining competencies and experience in programming, they would fit the mould in the most populous sector of the gaming industry. <br><br>
	As characterised by the nature of the work carried out to complete this group assignment, it can be reasonable to assume that our ideal jobs in the game development field, either as a software engineer or a developer programmer, can be conducted effectively remotely. This is evidenced that in these fields, 56% of employees work remotely and this is partly due to the nature of work performed significantly through the use of computers.
