<div style=margin:40px><p>My name is Keaton Ferber, I live in a small town in rural SA. I graduated Year 12 in 2014 and have previously worked as a cellar hand at a local winery for many years. My main hobby is playing video games, its something I’ve enjoyed since I was very young. I also enjoy watching movies, TV and anime. I’m a huge Star Wars fan and my favourite movie they have released is Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. My friend got me into watching F1 in 2020 and I’ve been following avidly since. I root for Ferrari and my favourite driver is Charles Leclerc. I love cats and have a cat named Ezra; he keeps me company.<br>
<br>My interest in IT started at a young age. My interest with technology started with playing video games on our PlayStation 2, but I also spent a lot of time on our family desktop computer. I’ve always found computers fascinating and enjoyed tinkering with them. For my research project in high school, I built my own desktop computer. I really enjoyed the process and still build and upgrade my PCs to this day. I chose to study at RMIT as I was looking to Study IT through Open Universities Australia (OUA), and RMIT was recommended. I expect to learn the skills required for my chosen career.</div>

<center><h2>Personality Profile</h2>
<center><h2>16 Personalities Test</h2>
	<img src = "images/KeatonPersonalityProfile.png" alt="KeatonPersonalityProfile"></center>
<p>My results for the “16 personalities test” showed that my personality type was a “Turbulent Adventurer”. According to the test my 5 dominant traits were, Introverted(I), Observant(S), Feeling(F), Prospecting(P) and Turbulent(-T). Due to having the shared personality traits of Observant and Prospecting I have the role of explorer. As I have the shared trait of Introverted(I) and Turbulent(-T) my strategy is constant improvement. The mostly introverted result is no surprise to me as I’ve always been an introverted person. I often keep to myself and prefer not to go out too much. Observant personality types tend to focus on what’s Infront of them, which makes them focused and functionable. Feeling personality types tend to be compassionate and follow their emotions. People with the prospecting trait tend to be flexible when dealing with challenges, they tend to adapt to the situation rather than control it. Turbulent personality types tend to be success driven and can get caught up in the details. <p>
<center><h2>Learning Style Assessment</h2>
	<img src = "images/KeatonLearningStyle.jpg" alt="KeatonLearningStyle"></center>
<p>In the “learning style test” my results were 35% Auditory 40% Visual and 25% Tactile. This is a mostly even split with me being slightly biased towards Auditory and Visual learning, and slightly biased against Tactile learning. Some things I can utilise to get the most out of visual learning is avoid distractions when studying and visualise things I hear. For the auditory aspect when reading aloud is important to make sure I remember the information. <p>
<center><h2>The Big 5 test</h2>	
	<img src = "images/Keaton5Factors.jpg" alt="Keaton5Factors"></center>
<p>In “The Big Five” test I scored High in neuroticism and agreeableness and low in Extraversion, Openness to experience and conscientious. I tend to think I get along with almost anyway and my high agreeableness reflects that.  High agreeableness also means I care about others and assist when needed.  The low score in extroversion correlates to the previously mentioned introvert personality type. People with low openness tend to be more practical and conventional in their methods, as well as not being as creative and imaginative. I struggle with creative work and do better when the work is more structured. Scoring on the lower end of continuousness means I need to work my organization skills and plan better as these skills are lacking. The high neuroticism tends to mean they are prone to stress and anxiety, which I can relate to when in high pressure situations. <p>
<center><h2>How this info helps the team</h2>	
<p>My high agreeableness means I will work well in a team due to being highly cooperative. I also believe being empathetic to my teammates will mean I will be able to avoid any conflicts. In a group due to being introverted I will most likely not be the chattiest person and will tend to follow rather than lead a team. Knowing this someone else should be a leader in the group. Due to my lower continuousness score it will be best if others handle the organizing side of group work. <p>
