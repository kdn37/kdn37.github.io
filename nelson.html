<h2>I'm an enthusiastic and positive individual that strives to do right by other people and also expect the same in return. I enjoy some sports, my hobbies range from playing golf to video games. I've spent the pandemic learning to broaden my culinary skills, developing my digital skills and learn new things and look forward to returning to the tropics, such as Thailand and Fiji. I was born in Melbourne and am descended from European migrants during the First and Second World Wars.<br><br>

My interest in IT stems from a relatively young age, by being mesmerised by the Sega Master System in the early 90's and exhibiting sensational rage-quitting skills to my parents, and developing a love for the art and design component of game design due to the visual display of Yoshi's Island and Donkey Kong Country 2 on the SNES. I recall a significant moment playing Yoshi's Island on Christmas morning in 1995 and my family and I struggled to proceed from a certain point in the first level and being able to overcome this obstacle in this level holds dear in my memory that will always return me back to that moment and where my real interest in IT began from - the solving of problems. Playing these games beyond what would be reasonable hours of an eight year old, I felt I had discovered my passion which I had never professionally realised yet and strive to follow a path and that is what motivated me to enrol at RMIT and study Information Technology - better late than never!<br>

	<p><h2>The Myer's Briggs test is an individual analysis how a person would interpret the world. Gauging from these results I'm a relatively balanced individual, classed as an advocate or as "the counselor".
		<center><img src="images/nelsonmb.png" height=480 width=640></center><br><br>
It's regarded as the most rarest personality type with estimation showing it represents two percent of the population, and being linked to notable figures such as Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King and Mother Theresa. Advocates are people that look for a purporse and have the sense they don't always fit in with those around them. As they generally care about others more than their personal gain, being an advocate is something that would be reliable within a team and ensuring a project is completed for the collective - and not the individual.</p><br><br>
<center><img src="images/nelsonls.png" height=100 width=640></center>
<p>Being an individual that learns in this method provides a confirmation bias that I am an individual that requires relatively constant stimulation to learn, as I do prefer being hands on, engaged and having the opportunity to demonstrate those learnings. Learners under this style tend to get bored easily and restless and require movement in order to learn, which relates back to the way I learn and practice, as well as an interest in sports and physical activity. Translating this towards a working environment is reflective of the way I conduct myself as I would consider myself very hands on, from actively engaging with clients, mentoring new employees to facilitating projects within the organisation as a project lead.</p>
<center><img src="images/nelsonb5.png" height=400 width=750></center><p>The Big 5 personality test takes into account factors that form an individual's personality and how they interpret the world. Based on this test, being open and agreeable are the strongest factors in my personality, which makes the working environment cohesive and easy to work with in a team setting. This provides optimal momentum in being able to navigate dynamics that may provide barrier in completing work required and being agreeable provides that further understanding and a sense of altruism which is important in an effective team environment, and relates back to being an advocate under the Myers Brigg's model.
