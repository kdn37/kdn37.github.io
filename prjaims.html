<center><h1>Aims</h1></center>
<div style=margin:60px>
	<h2>Aim</h2>
The aim of our project is to deliver a fully functioning shopping list and kitchen supply maintenance application. Ideally our app will have multiple features including a commercial app to aid small businesses with an easy ordering inventory management process. The app will have a home screen with trending recipes, a section where you can see what recipes are available to make based off your “inventory”, make an order/shopping list, my inventory and finally our premium feature Business+.<br><br>
	<center><h1>Goals</h1></center>
	<br><br><h2>My Inventory</h2>
This is the most important feature of the app as it brings all the functions of the app together. On first setup it will request that the user adds their inventory into the app via searching the product or by scanning the barcode. This feature will also have all necessary nutritional information as well as an option for perishable items such as chicken or milk to manually enter a preference for number of days that you want to keep it and when there is a day left on the perishable product it will push a notification through to the user. In this feature you can set preferences on what brand you like for certain products whether that would be a Coles home brand product or an item from an international section, the customisability is at the users’ fingertips. This feature will connect to what to cook section as it has your available ingredients and will also be updated once the recipe is complete. <br><br>
	<h2>Trending Recipes</h2>
This section is as the title says, based off users of our application we will make a list of recipes that are currently trending globally and tell the user what ingredients they need to cook this recipe as well as an option to quick add to cart the items that are required.<br><br>
	<h2>What to Make</h2>
This section is as the title says, based off users of our application we will make a list of recipes that are currently trending globally and tell the user what ingredients they need to cook this recipe as well as an option to quick add to cart the items that are required.<br><br>
	<h2>Shopping List</h2>
The goal of this feature is to provide a shopping list based on what ingredients that users have ran out of through cooking or through manual entry. The feature will also have an option to add the home brand products to the cart or opt for the more expensive versions. At any point in time if you decide that you are ready to finish your shop you will have the option to export your cart to Coles or Woolworths for online order via click and collect or home delivery as well as the speedier option through a delivery partner such as Door Dash.<br><br>
	<h2>Business+</h2>
This is our premium feature available on a recurring subscription basis where local cafes and restaurants can connect to local suppliers to help with an easy ordering system. This feature will have the ability to liaise between the suppliers and the restaurant providing key information to the business owner on trending items that are increasing in sold volume for marketing purposes as well as the less performing products for “daily specials” options to try and push sales on the product. The way this works will be that you can send a notification to a supplier when you are running low on certain products and an algorithm will be used for your order based on the number of days you want the product to last and adjust the order based off the sales history between your previous order and time of current order considering the trends from previous orders. A report would be able to be generated to show the percentage increases in sales of certain items for example you want to see if chicken breast is selling more over the past 6 months compared to the year all you need to do is pull the report and check chicken breast to see the data on this.
