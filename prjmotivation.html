<h1> Project Motivation </h1>
<p> 

The motivation behind our project Shop Mate is the idea of having a whole collection of amazing features at your fingertips. Inspiration was drawn from the MyFitnessPal as well as ideas drawn from the convenience of online shopping. The amount of times where I’m stuck for ideas for dinner and can’t think of anything to make and wish that I had an app that would tell me what I can make with the ingredients that I have in the house. This is where the idea sparked for Shop Mate, an app where I could just put in the ingredients that I have in the kitchen and then I get a list of recipes available for food that I have. The app obviously is a high demand task that will require multiple revisions however with phase 1 of the app coming in the form of a simple shopping list. Having an interest in nutrition through a brief period of study as well as an interest in fitness, I'm fascinated by the idea of tracking macronutrients and the idea of having an app that brings the convenience of online shopping together with a stored database of available products with their given macro nutrients is a huge motivator for the app too.  </p>
