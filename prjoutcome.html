<div style=margin:40px><p>The main outcome that the team is hoping to accomplish with Shop Mate is to have a functioning app containing all the features mentioned in the flow chart above. Our team is aware of time constraints for assignment 3 and realize that features wonâ€™t be available come the submission of assignment 3. With that in mind we are hoping to have a user interface prepared and a basic shopping list app ready for use by the time the assignment is due. We will be including a demo on our GitHub website with a sample of what the app will look like for desktop/laptops. We will be attempting to develop the app using a tool such as appypie to create our app.</p>
<p>Given the tools available for smaller developers being able to build applications with programs like Adobe XD, it will be in the best interest of the group's likelihood to have a product feasibly produced in the restrictive timeframe. Because of this, it is possible that time limitations may render what Thirty Seven is able to produce in lieu of what we desire to. However that is not to remove the notion of the product, its utility and feasibility.</p>

<p>On a long-term schedule, we would like to continue to develop the project and the outlined roadmap above is the schedule that we would like to follow. As beginners in the IT space, we are aware that these things will take time and a lot of effort which is way it has been spaced out in a manner so that we can achieve these targets without taking on too much workload at any given time.
