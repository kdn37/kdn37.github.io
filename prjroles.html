Walking into app devlopment with little to no experience can be an intimidating offset, where research goes into the success of other project teams that are established, it felt best to do some research in how successful operations are conducted and importantly the 'who' behind these teams.
	
After extensive research, a development team guide established by <a href="https://themindstudios.com/blog/mobile-app-development-team/">The Mind Studios</a> felt the best resource to measure the particular roles that would be required for the professional development and public release of ShopMate.
	
<h2>Project Manager</h2>
Floating the product idea requires a position where accountability and responsibility is held, and this is done so by the project manager. Their role is to oversee the beginning and completion of the application within the organisation, essentially as outlined by The Mind Studios; a project manager responsibilities are:<br><br>
• Determining the purpose of the application<br>
• What the solutions this application will solve<br>
• The validation of the project's aims and goals<br>
• Creating a product roadmap its developmental process<br>
• Working towards a timeline and within an established budget<br><br>

Project managers are an integral part of any development team, as their success will translate to the success of the project in question. Without a project manager, the role undefined can cause confusion amongst a development team as there may be conflicting ideas how the product can be implemented, supported and ultimately utilised by its target audience. By practicing their responsibilities they're able to validate the idea of the project, ascertain the scope and limits of development cycle, the distribution of work by relevant job postings, managing the time structure from conceptualisation to the release of the product and importantly working within the financial means of capital contributed to the project. Without a project manager, the timeline, budget and employee morale and lack of direction could render a failure and waste of time.
