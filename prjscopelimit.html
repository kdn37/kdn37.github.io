<center><h1>Scope & Limits</h1></center>
<div style=margin:60px>
As this project is a large undertaking, we will require several phases of our project to ensure the best user experience and to not release clunky incomplete features, as a team we discussed the best approach to this, and we believe that ultimately there are four phase that we would like to launch the product in.
	<br><br><h2>Phase 1</h2>
The features we want to make available for this would be an inventory system without the nutritional information or recipes section and the shopping list feature where it would simply function as just a list (without the order function). This would be a similar range to what we would like to present for our assignment.
	<br><br><h2>Phase 2</h2>
We will bring the app to be available for download on the app store, the included features will be that of phase 1 with the addition of the what to make section and trending recipes.
	<br><br><h2>Phase 3</h2>
Phase 3 of our project we intend to deliver our nutritional information function to the inventory as well as the full functionality of the Shopping list feature; the add to cart from recipes, exporting to Coles and Woolworths as well as the Door Dash function.
	<br><br><h2>Phase 4</h2>
This is where we intend to deliver our business+ feature where it will be initially demoed with a few local businesses so we can test its viability and improve on it from there.
