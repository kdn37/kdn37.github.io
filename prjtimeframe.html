  <tr>
    <th> Week </th>
    <th>Task Outlined</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 1</td>
    <td>Visualisation and mockup of the ShopMate application.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 2</td>
    <td>Research tools and resources that will supplement the development of the mockup program.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 3</td>
    <td>Encourage the team to familarise themselves with Adobe Creative Suite, such as Adobe XD, Photoshop and Dreamweaver. Appypie eliminated due to the cost factor.</td>
  </tr>
	  <tr>
    <td>Week 4</td>
    <td>Create application mockup using Adobe XD. Python program put forward for database management.</td>
  </tr>
	  <tr>
    <td>Week 5</td>
    <td>Execution of mockup design, detailed product plan outlined and Python program designing the implementation of proposed information to be inputted.</td>
  </tr>
	  <tr>
    <td>Week 6</td>
    <td>Genenerated mockup presentation of the application at work. Refine documented proposal on the application's benefit to a consumer in the marketplace, what the features and benefits are to prospective stakeholders.</td>
  </tr>
	  <tr>
    <td>Week 7</td>
    <td>Discovery and recruitment drive. The hiring of a project manager and product manager for the application, user interface, user experience designer, cross-platform and backend developer and quality assurance engineer. </td>

	  <tr>
    <td>Week 10</td>
    <td>Using the data imported by the user, to have the capacity to send a shopping list to a local shopping partner, such as an IGA grocer or to Coles Online and have the order fulfilled based on automatic replenishment for a consumer. Ensure the testing phase for the UI/UX integration is seamless.</td>
  </tr>
		<tr>
    <td>Week 11</td>
    <td>Program macronutrients into populated recipes and expand the library of recipes for the app to retrieve. The development timeframe needs to be allowed to push through any lag in delay of app development in the following weeks and thorough testing to ensure the value proposition is accurate to the program's promise.</td>

    <td>Week 12</td>
    <td>Just like the previous week any outstanding design work, implementations and testing is to be conducted during this week.</td>
