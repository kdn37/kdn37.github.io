The app will have a few features, to start off it will be separate the database of meals based off what meal you want to prepare; for example, breakfast will include things like smoothies but not for dinner. You could put in as few or as many ingredients as you want for the meal and it will come up with a result so long as the database has a match with the ingredients stored in it.

I would ideally like to create a feature for that app that lets you favorite and save meals, and even compile an inventory on what you have in the house. With the inventory feature when you select a meal that you are cooking it would remove the ingredients from your inventory and then it will add it to a shopping list feature.

The shopping list feature could be linked to Woolworths or Coles online shopping or even just a standard list itself that you can take to the shops but in an ideal world would have the capability to once you are ready to send an order for the shopping list it can add to cart all the ingredients that you need so that you donâ€™t need to think about it. Expanding on the shopping list section with your favorited meals it would give the option to give notifications if you are out of an ingredient for example chicken and you have chicken soup favorited it will give you a notification that you have no chicken with the option to press a button to add chicken to the list/cart.
