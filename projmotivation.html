<center><h1>The Motivation</h1>

<div style=margin:40px><p>
The motivation behind our project Shop Mate is the idea of having a whole collection of amazing features at your fingertips. Inspiration was drawn from the MyFitnessPal as well as ideas drawn from the convenience of online shopping. The amount of times where I’m stuck for ideas for dinner and can’t think of anything to make and wish that I had an app that would tell me what I can make with the ingredients that I have in the house. This is where the idea sparked for Shop Mate, an app where I could just put in the ingredients that I have in the kitchen and then I get a list of recipes available for food that I have. <br><br>The app obviously is a high demand task that will require multiple revisions however with phase 1 of the app coming in the form of a simple shopping list. Having an interest in nutrition through a brief period of study as well as an interest in fitness, I'm fascinated by the idea of tracking macronutrients and the idea of having an app that brings the convenience of online shopping together with a stored database of available products with their given macro nutrients is a huge motivator for the app too.

<center><h1>Project Overview</h1>
<img src = "yeet.png" width="20%" height="55%"></center>
<div style=margin:40px><p>
I want to design an app, the purpose of the app would be to get information from the user in regards to what food they have in the kitchen, they would enter it into the app and then the app would compile a list of recipes that they can make with the food that they have available, the name is a work in progress but along the lines of ‘What can I make with this?’. It would most likely be a smartphone app with compatibility for things like google home and Alexa.<br><br>
	
**Shopmate was visualised by Dean Heighway as a smartphone app that could be used to compile a list of food that is in a user’s kitchen, which would then produce recipe ideas based on what the home kitchen’s inventory has. 


Shopmate is a product that could be used on a smart-device or computer and to have the purpose of obtaining information from the user in regards to what food they have in the kitchen, compiling it into an app which would then produce recipes that best match the input by the user. The long term goal of the app would be for it to have connectivity to any of the big supermarket chains, such as Woolworths, Coles, Aldi or IGA, but the opportunity to work with smaller grocery chains would be a better utility to provide support for local suppliers and their stakeholders.

As Dean emphasised in the proposition of the project, the ease of connectivity would be strengthened by using smart devices around the home, such as Google Home or Alexa. The idea of implementing a ‘days until perish’ for itinerary would be a
