It is somewhat difficult to really measure by percentage the volume of work done by each member, so it is best to outline the roles and responsibilities of each member, which in a sense reflects a working environment within an organisation regardless.
	<h2>Keaton Ferber:</h2>
	In addition to completing their individual profile, Keaton compiled a report on Mark Zuckerberg, on Cyber Security and researching the extensive skills that would be required for the Project Idea and formed the Skills component.
	<h2>Dean Heighway:</h2>
	As Thirty Seven elected to choose Dean Heighway's project idea from assignment one, it was in the best interest of the group for them to provide the Overview and Motivation of the project idea. They worked with Nelson to design the logo to potentially use for the Project Idea - ShopMate. Dean also provided reports on Machine Learning, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. They also provided the summary of their team profile. It was fitting they also developed the Outcome component for the Project Idea. 
	<h2>Sean Heighway:</h2>
	Sean was added to Thirty Seven late due to the nature of the structure of the group assignments but contributed at an equivalent level, adding their work to the team profile, reporting on Robotics and on Vitalik Buterin.
	<h2>Nelson Kun:</h2>
	Nelson, in addition to Dean and Keaton was one of the original members of the group and designed the website from the ground up. Time was put into meticulously ensuring the design was consistent on each page, with every link working perfectly and a seamless navigation menu bar. They provided reports on Changpeng Zhao and Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies. They researched the Tools and Technologies to be used for the Project Idea and compiled information relevant to Industry Data. 
	
<br><br>When working as a team, it is important to work to each others strengths so on that note it is understood that our audit trail on github isn't necessarily the most fair display of what work was done by who. The group has worked well to endeavour what we feel is a positive result through the use of technologies available, such as Teams and Discord for communications. Our meetings show that we had an enlightening dynamic and one that is rare to find even of the most optimal working environments.
