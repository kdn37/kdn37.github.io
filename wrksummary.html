<strong>Q: What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong><br>
<p>Elon Musk is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world, he is the CEO of Tesla and Space X working primarily in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). His workweek is reported to be 8-100 hours per week split between his two main companies. He is known as an extremely ambitious man with a primary goal of colonizing mars through his work with SpaceX.  </p>
<strong>Q: What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong><br>
<p>Elon is one of the busiest people in the world, his meeting schedule is extremely time consuming and hectic, meeting with people from all aspects of life on a daily basis. He communicates heavily with his teams to try and make sure that his vision for his products is kept to his standard as he is still at heart an engineer and wants his products made the way he designed it. As well as heavy communication with his team Musk also spends a lot of his meetings interacting with stakeholders in his company as well as a lot of his team communicating his vision and goals to the public. Overall, Musk is an extremely dedicated and focused individual who once starts work on a project he is passionate on cannot control himself from devoting all of his time to the project.  </p>
<strong>Q: Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
<p>Most of Musk’s time is spent in three different spots, the first is meetings. Musk spends a large amount of time in meetings so much so that he has organized the structure of his meetings implementing a set of rules to be followed, the first rule is to keep meetings to a small number of people in order to keep productivity. The second rule he has is that if you don’t have anything to contribute to the meeting then leave. This rule is not meant as a disrespect it is just simply in place so that if you have nothing to offer to the meeting you are wasting your own time and others in the meeting, he would rather that time be spend more productively. </p>
<p>Another portion of his time is spent designing and engineering new products as well as developing new features for his existing products. Musk is still an engineer at a base level and as his companies are his own, he wants to ensure that the products produce the same vision that he has in mind when developing the products. Musk devotes a fair portion of his time to the development of his products. </p>
<p>Finally, almost every day he works Musk likes to spend around an hour at the end of the day on the factory floor to make sure production is running efficiently and to handle any problems that me be arising. As well as this he likes to oversee production to find any efficiencies that could be implemented to smooth out the process. </p>
<strong>Q: What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong><br>
	<p>Musk is an extremely public figure, publicly noted as one of the wealthiest people in the world. His goals and ambitions are well known by all and one of the challenges that arise when this happens is everything he does in under the microscope. Due to his heavy workload a lot would assume that the hours he puts into his work is the challenge however Musk is quite the opposite of this stating that when he is passionate about a project, he finds it easy to lose himself in it and spend freakish amounts of time on a certain project in a small amount of time. </p></div>

<div style=margin:40px>
	<p>Changpeng Zhao, is the founder of and runs Binance, one of the worlds most popular Crypto Currency trading platforms in the world. He is an active social media influencer, predominately on Twitter and is regarded as a centric figure in the blockchain and crypto currency industry. <br><br>Part of his view as CEO, and the key driver of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is the decentralised aspect of the industry – is that there is a need for a centralised exchange, which is what Binance is. His belief is because there needs to be a way for the flow of money towards a cryptocurrency by means of using traditional currency, alas fiat.<br><br>
	Given the nature of the workplace has evolved, particularly due to COVID his belief is that productive and meaningful work can be done not necessarily at an office or a company’s headquarters but remotely from home or anywhere in the world.<br><br><!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9F9_pzVG7w--></p>
<strong>Q: What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong><br>
<p>In terms of the company, they employ thousands of people to provide the customer service that ought to be expected for a company that services over 90 million users. This is facilitated mainly using infrastructure dedicated in the IT spectrum, from social media channels like Twitter and instant messaging platforms such as Telegram.</p>
<strong>Q: What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong><br>
<p>Answer</p>
<strong>Q: Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
<p>As CZ discusses the accessibility of work from home as if work that can be done from home or remotely it is reasonable to assume he works in this same method.****extend</p>
<strong>Q: What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong><br>
	<p>The challenging part of their role operating a popular cryptocurrency exchange is catering to the expectations of their community – as the frequent request to listing a certain project holds the prospective customer’s motive to make a significant financial gain whereas Binance’s core values are about the quality of the project, and given the volume of projects and tokens that are created, only 0.01% of projects actually end up being listed on the exchange, on top of the challenges with catering to the interests of its customers, more serious challenges face Changpeng Zhao and Binance are regulations. The definition of what whether cryptocurrencies can be determined as a security by the SEC has really hampered the industry in a scope to really class it as what some call a ponzi scheme, and to move away from that stigma. Considering that anyone can mint a token on the Binance Smart Chain damages the legitimacy of any project and it asks the question if it’s because of this reputation of “less than desirable coins” being easily accessible and created on its network, does this damage its seriousness of an institution?</p></div>
