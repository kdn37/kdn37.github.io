<strong>Q: Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
<p>Unlike most CEOs of big tech companies Mark seems to have a healthy work life balance.

He says he tries to do this at least week times a week. Mark says he only works 50-60 traditional hours at Facebook.

<strong>Q: What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong><br>

<div style=margin:60px><center><h9>Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, CEO of SpaceX.</h9><br>

<strong>Q: What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong><br>
<p>Elon Musk is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world, he is the CEO of Tesla and Space X working primarily in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). His workweek is reported to be 8-100 hours per week split between his two main companies. He is known as an extremely ambitious man with a primary goal of colonizing mars through his work with SpaceX.</p>
<strong>Q: What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong><br>
<p>Elon is one of the busiest people in the world, his meeting schedule is extremely time consuming and hectic, meeting with people from all aspects of life on a daily basis. He communicates heavily with his teams to try and make sure that his vision for his products is kept to his standard as he is still at heart an engineer and wants his products made the way he designed it. As well as heavy communication with his team Musk also spends a lot of his meetings interacting with stakeholders in his company as well as a lot of his team communicating his vision and goals to the public. Overall, Musk is an extremely dedicated and focused individual who once starts work on a project he is passionate on cannot control himself from devoting all of his time to the project.</p>
<strong>Q: Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
<p>Most of Musk’s time is spent in three different spots, the first is meetings. Musk spends a large amount of time in meetings so much so that he has organized the structure of his meetings implementing a set of rules to be followed, the first rule is to keep meetings to a small number of people in order to keep productivity. The second rule he has is that if you don’t have anything to contribute to the meeting then leave. This rule is not meant as a disrespect it is just simply in place so that if you have nothing to offer to the meeting you are wasting your own time and others in the meeting, he would rather that time be spend more productively.

Another portion of his time is spent designing and engineering new products as well as developing new features for his existing products. Musk is still an engineer at a base level and as his companies are his own, he wants to ensure that the products produce the same vision that he has in mind when developing the products. Musk devotes a fair portion of his time to the development of his products.

Finally, almost every day he works Musk likes to spend around an hour at the end of the day on the factory floor to make sure production is running efficiently and to handle any problems that me be arising. As well as this he likes to oversee production to find any efficiencies that could be implemented to smooth out the process.</p>
<strong>Q: What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong><br>
	<p>Musk is an extremely public figure, publicly noted as one of the wealthiest people in the world. His goals and ambitions are well known by all and one of the challenges that arise when this happens is everything he does in under the microscope. Due to his heavy workload a lot would assume that the hours he puts into his work is the challenge however Musk is quite the opposite of this stating that when he is passionate about a project, he finds it easy to lose himself in it and spend freakish amounts of time on a certain project in a small amount of time.</p></div>

<div style=margin:40px>
	<p>Changpeng Zhao, is the founder of and runs Binance, one of the worlds most popular Crypto Currency trading platforms in the world. He is an active social media influencer, predominately on Twitter and is regarded as a centric figure in the blockchain and crypto currency industry. <br><br>Part of his view as CEO, and the key driver of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is the decentralised aspect of the industry – is that there is a need for a centralised exchange, which is what Binance is. His belief is because there needs to be a way for the flow of money towards a cryptocurrency by means of using traditional currency, alas fiat.<br><br>
	Given the nature of the workplace has evolved, particularly due to COVID his belief is that productive and meaningful work can be done not necessarily at an office or a company’s headquarters but remotely from home or anywhere in the world.<br><br><!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9F9_pzVG7w--></p>
<strong>Q: What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong><br>
<p>Changpeng wakes up knowing that the day will be different to the last but that it won’t be boring to the least. He commences his day of work by checking his phone for messages from fellow employees and schedules according to any agendas that may be required to be set, in doing so it’s important in his role as CEO to be adaptive. Although a CEO, he will still provide a level of customer service. There was a time he would limit his audience to LinkedIn where it came to providing an update to the customer base, but as time has marched on it became more of a necessity to be transparent on social media such as Twitter as those in the crypto sphere would consider them to be an influencer. Ensuring their day is effectively spent running the organisation they would schedule no more than three meetings during the day, where a meeting would run for 15-, 30- or 45-minute intervals. As a CEO he always finds the value of continuous learning, whether being a language or a new facet to understand.</p>
<strong>Q: What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong><br>
<p>As part of their role as CEO, Changpeng interacts with a broad spectrum of individuals in not just within their organisaiton but the macro environment aswell. From engaging with customers on Twitter to the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele – who has been a prominent figure in championing for legitimising Bitcoin as legal tender and driving adoption globally, Changpeng maintains consistent messaging about the importance of decentralised finance. </p>
<strong>Q: Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
<p>As COVID came into being and a pandemic been declared, the norm of working from home has become more prevalent, as it’s demonstrated that effective work can be done remotely. Binance has multiple offices located worldwide, but Changpeng likes the idea of being able to work from anywhere, as they find the accessibility of Airbnb and Uber to explore new cities and help further expand the company and decentralised finance’s reach.</p>
<strong>Q: What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong><br>
	<p>The challenging part of their role operating a popular cryptocurrency exchange is catering to the expectations of their community – as the frequent request to listing a certain project holds the prospective customer’s motive to make a significant financial gain whereas Binance’s core values are about the quality of the project, and given the volume of projects and tokens that are created, only 0.01% of projects actually end up being listed on the exchange, on top of the challenges with catering to the interests of its customers, more serious challenges face Changpeng Zhao and Binance are regulations. The definition of what whether cryptocurrencies can be determined as a security by the SEC has really hampered the industry in a scope to really class it as what some call a ponzi scheme, and to move away from that stigma. Considering that anyone can mint a token on the Binance Smart Chain damages the legitimacy of any project and it asks the question if it’s because of this reputation of “less than desirable coins” being easily accessible and created on its network, does this damage its seriousness of an institution?</p></div>

He has a rule for his meetings he describes as the two-pizza rule, this means that meeting should not be so large that two pizzas will not be enough to feed everyone at the meeting.

The other window where he believes is the peak of his productivity is early evening and he will also do a lot of his work during this productive period.</p>
