<strong>Q: What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong><br>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is the chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder of Meta Platforms. He co-founded the company formally known as Facebook Inc in 2004. As the CEO of Meta Platforms, he is responsible for setting the overall direction and production strategy for the company. Mark also says even when he’s not working he spends most of his time thinking of ways to improve their platform.</p>
<strong>Q: What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong><br>
<p>As the CEO of Meta Mark interacts with a variety of people. He interacts with many employees of Meta. He also has meetings with potential investors of Meta Platforms. As the head of a social media company, he is a public figure. He works with his social media team to interact with the general public on social media. Mark has met with many high-profile people, he has had meetings with the Pope, President of the United States, Vin Diesel and the French President.</p>
<strong>Q: Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
<p>Unlike most CEOs of big tech companies Mark seems to have a healthy work life balance. He starts his day at 8am and the first thing he does in the morning is checks Facebook, Facebook messenger and what’s app. His morning routine consists of either going for a run or working out. He says he tries to do this at least week times a week. Mark says he only works 50-60 traditional hours at Facebook. However, he also says, “I spend most of my time thinking about how to connect the world and serve our community better, but a lot of that time isn’t in our office or meeting with people or doing what you’d call real work,”. His schedule varies greatly when he is traveling, whether it to meet the Pope or the President of the United States. Between all this mark still finds time to spend with his family.</p>
<strong>Q: What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong><br>
	<p>Musk is an extremely public figure, publicly noted as one of the wealthiest people in the world. His goals and ambitions are well known by all and one of the challenges that arise when this happens is everything he does in under the microscope. Due to his heavy workload a lot would assume that the hours he puts into his work is the challenge however Musk is quite the opposite of this stating that when he is passionate about a project, he finds it easy to lose himself in it and spend freakish amounts of time on a certain project in a small amount of time.</p></div>
